in all files, we fix lower weight = -10, target return = 5, and shift prop = 5

we still let dominating term in the cost function = 2...

so we remove these name dependencies in the name...

we only consider the combination change w.r.t. sample number + feature dimension?

e.g. temp4(xx)_100_30 means that we inherit the case in the 0723-mis folder, with sample size = 100, and feature dim = 30.


need to adjust the DGP setup at the first and in the class of DGP...

each column represent nonparametric + GAN + beta (underlying true cases...)
